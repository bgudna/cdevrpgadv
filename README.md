# cdevrpgadv
 * development and testing of various C funtions for a CLI rpg/adventure
 * an exercise in plain C development
 * you'll need these to get this running: 
  * * * gcc to compile
  * * * gdb to debug
  * * * libncurses-dev for the fancy layouts 
 * * build and debug scripts for vscode included
 * don't forget to create /build before running the make file :P

## TODO
 - [ ] add character creation in the beginning
 - [ ] add ncurses for UI goodness
 - [ ] generate lore 

 > this is just a stream of conciousness list, it will grow with further ideas if I ever get anywhere in this
